# BackproPygation
## About
This is an implementation of the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network using Python.  
Based on the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=4) by 3Blue1Brown.
## Usage
This project makes use of the MNIST number dataset to train the neural network. The training and testing images and labels con be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZiNnV3YtpZ7d9afHZg0rtDRrmhha-1E/view) and are needed to be in a *dataset* directory.  
Alternatively, a module like Keras can be used to import this data, but this would require the rewriting of the `mnist_utils.py` script file. 
To run the main script, it's necessary to first compile the `libs` directory.
